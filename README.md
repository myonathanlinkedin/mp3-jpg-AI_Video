# Advanced AI Video Generator with Multi-Scale Long Sentence Matching

A cutting-edge AI-powered video generator that creates perfectly synchronized lyric videos from static images and audio files. This project uses advanced AI techniques including Whisper for speech-to-text, multi-scale Faiss semantic search, and adaptive language detection to achieve superior lyric synchronization, especially for long sentences.

## üéØ Final Approach

**Multi-Scale AI Text Extraction + Advanced Semantic Matching + Long Sentence Optimization**: The system uses OpenAI Whisper with enhanced segmentation to extract text from audio, then employs multi-scale Faiss-powered semantic search with adaptive language detection for intelligent lyric matching, especially optimized for long sentences that were previously missed.

### Key Features

- **Enhanced AI Text Extraction**: Uses OpenAI Whisper with enhanced segmentation for better long sentence capture
- **Multi-Scale Semantic Search**: Uses Faiss with small, medium, and large chunks to capture both short phrases and long sentences
- **Adaptive Language Detection**: Automatically detects English vs Indonesian lyrics for optimal timing
- **Long Sentence Optimization**: Specialized algorithms for handling complex, long sentences
- **File-Based Lyrics**: Reads lyrics from external files instead of hardcoded arrays
- **Advanced Timing Validation**: Intelligent timing adjustment based on language, word count, and vocal speed
- **Color-Coded Display**: Different colors for English (white) and Indonesian (yellow) lyrics
- **Adaptive Fade Effects**: Fade duration adjusts based on language and sentence length
- **Perfect Synchronization**: Text displayed matches perfectly with audio timing
- **Smooth Image Animation**: Complex multi-frequency transformations (zoom, pan, rotation)
- **Complete Coverage**: All lyrics displayed from start to finish with proper timing

## üéµ How It Works

1. **Enhanced AI Text Extraction**: OpenAI Whisper analyzes the MP3 file with enhanced segmentation to extract spoken text with word-level timestamps, optimized for long sentences
2. **Multi-Scale Index Building**: Creates semantic embeddings using Sentence Transformers and builds Faiss index with small, medium, and large chunks
3. **Adaptive Language Detection**: Automatically detects English vs Indonesian lyrics for optimal timing and display
4. **Multi-Scale Semantic Search**: For each lyric, performs semantic search using multiple scales:
   - Small chunks (3-6 words) for keyword matching
   - Medium chunks (6-12 words) for phrase matching  
   - Large chunks (12-20 words) for long sentence matching
5. **Advanced Matching Algorithm**: Uses adaptive thresholds and similarity boosting based on:
   - Language match (English/Indonesian)
   - Sentence length and scale preference
   - Word count similarity
6. **Adaptive Duration Calculation**: Calculates optimal lyric duration based on:
   - Language (Indonesian typically longer)
   - Word count (longer sentences get more time)
   - Vocal speed analysis
7. **File-Based Processing**: Reads lyrics from `comparison_lyrics.txt` and saves results to separate files
8. **Advanced Timing Validation**: Intelligent timing adjustment with language-aware overlap resolution
9. **Video Generation**: Creates smooth animated frames with:
   - Multi-frequency zoom, pan, and rotation
   - Color-coded lyric display (white for English, yellow for Indonesian)
   - Adaptive fade effects based on language and sentence length
   - Professional video output
